Stethoscope AI is an on-demand expert consultant for complex server issues. It allows users to run a secure, read-only script on their Linux server, which generates a snapshot of the system's performance and security configuration. This snapshot is then analyzed by a powerful AI backend to provide a comprehensive health report with actionable insights and solutions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **AI-Powered Analysis:** Leverages Google's Gemini AI to provide human-like reasoning, root cause analysis, and expert recommendations.
* **Comprehensive Health Report:** Analyzes performance, security, package updates, and more.
* **Server Security Score:** Proactively identifies security vulnerabilities (SSH config, firewall status) and provides a score out of 100.
* **Outdated Package Detection:** Identifies critical software (like OpenSSH) that needs updating.
* **Google SSO & History:** Securely sign in with your Google account and access your last 5 analysis reports.
* **Agentless & Secure:** Uses a 100% read-only script. No agents to install, no daemons to run. Your data is processed in-memory and immediately discarded.
* **Instant Metrics Dashboard:** Visualizes key metrics like OS info, uptime, and resource utilization as soon as you provide the snapshot.

## üöÄ How It Works

The process is designed to be simple and secure:

1.  **Get The Command:** Copy the `curl` command from the web interface.
2.  **Run on Your Server:** Execute the command via SSH on any Linux server. It gathers a comprehensive snapshot and outputs a Base64 encoded string.
3.  **Get AI-Powered Insights:** Paste the output into the web app and instantly receive your detailed report.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is composed of three main parts:

| Component         | Technology                                                              | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frontend** | `HTML`, `Tailwind CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Chart.js`, `Marked.js`           | A static, single-page application that serves as the user interface.           |
| **Backend** | `Python 3.10+`, `FastAPI`, `Uvicorn`                                    | A high-performance API that handles data decoding, analysis, and database interactions. |
| **AI & Database** | `Google Gemini API`, `Google Cloud Firestore`                           | The core AI for analysis and a NoSQL database for storing user analysis history. |
| **Script** | `Bash`                                                                  | The agentless, read-only script that collects server metrics.                  |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* A Google Account for authentication and API keys.
* A Firebase project with Firestore enabled.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/stethoscope-ai.git](https://github.com/your_username/stethoscope-ai.git)
    cd stethoscope-ai
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    * Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
    * Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and populate it with your credentials. See the **Configuration** section below.
    * Run the backend server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
    * The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    * Open the `index.html` file in your browser. No build step is required.
    * **Important:** Make sure the `API_ENDPOINT` variable in the `<script>` section of `index.html` points to your backend URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

## üîë Configuration

The backend requires a `.env` file with the following environment variables:

* **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`**: Your Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 Client ID for the web application.
* **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**: Your API key for the Google Gemini AI.
* **`FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS`**: The entire content of your Firebase service account JSON key file, pasted as a single-line string.

**Example `.env` file:**
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="https://www.google.com/search?q=xxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com"GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSyAxxxxxxxxxxxx"FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS='{"type": "service_account", "project_id": "...", ...}'
